A demo collection that shows other content as child pages.

===

This page demonstrates the collection/blog features of the Hypertext theme.  Each section is a group of fake pages that give you an idea of how the theme responds to different kinds of content.

This page is also an example of the `collection` page type.  It's a collection of sub-pages, and is identical to the `blog` and `blog_list` page types in other themes.
