Hi, Michelle here! Today, let's dive into the world of program control flows in JavaScript, a fundamental concept that guides the order in which your code executes. Control flow statements like `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and conditional operators dictate how your program responds to different conditions and how it iterates through data. For example, `if-else` allows you to execute code based on certain conditions:

```javascript
if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot outside!");
} else {
  console.log("It's not so hot today.");
}
```

Adding loops into the mix, we can handle repetitive tasks efficiently:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Loop iteration:", i);
}
```

Each control flow statement serves a unique purpose, enabling you to build more dynamic, responsive, and powerful web applications. Understanding and mastering these will significantly enhance your coding proficiency!
